getopt provides an interface for parsing command line arguments and
automatically generates a brief help message explaining the command usage. See
[[parse]] for the main entry point.

The help text is brief and should serve only as a reminder. It is recommended
that your command line program be accompanied by a man page to provide detailed
usage information.
