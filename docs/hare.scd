# DESCRIPTION

; TODO: Decide on and document driver exit statuses
*hare build* compiles a Hare program into an executable. The _path_ argument
shall be either the path to a Hare source file, or to a directory which contains
a Hare module (see *MODULES* below), or may be omitted, in which case the
working directory shall contain the Hare module to build.

*hare deps* queries the dependencies graph of a Hare program. The _path_ argument
is equivalent in usage to *hare build*.

*hare run* compiles and runs a Hare program. The _path_ argument is equivalent
in usage to *hare build*. If provided, any additional _args_ are passed to the
Hare program which is run. os::args[0] is set to the _path_ argument.

*hare test* compiles and runs tests for Hare code. All Hare modules in the
current working directory are recursively discovered, built, and their tests
made eligible for the test run. If the _test_ argument is omitted, all tests are
run. Otherwise, the list of named tests are run. *hare test* adds the +test and
+debug tags to the default build tags.

*hare version* prints version information for the *hare* program. If *-v* is
supplied, it also prints information about the build parameters. The output
format is consistent for machine reading: the first line is always "Hare version
$version". Subsequent lines give configuration values in the form of a name,
value, and optional context, separated by tabs.

# OPTIONS

## hare build

*-c*
	Compile only, do not link. The output is an object file (for Hare-only
	modules) or archive (for mixed source modules).

*-v*
	Enable verbose logging. Prints every command to stderr before executing
	it.

*-D* _ident:type=value_
	Passed to *harec*(1) to define an object in the type system. _ident_
	shall be the identifier of this object (e.g. foo::bar::baz), _type_
	shall be its type (in Hare syntax, e.g. "str" or
	"struct { x: int, y: int }"), and _value_ shall be the desired value (as a
	Hare expression, e.g. "42"). Take care to address any necessary
	escaping to avoid conflicts between your shell syntax and Hare syntax.

*-j* _jobs_
	Defines the maximum number of jobs which *hare* will execute in
	parallel. The default is the number of processors available on the host.

*-l* _name_
	Link with the named system library. The name is passed to
	*pkg-config --libs* (see *pkg-config*(1)) to obtain the appropriate
	linker flags.

*-o* _path_
	Set the output file to the given path.

*-t* _arch_
	Set the desired architecture for cross-compiling. See *ARCHITECTURES*
	for supported architecture names.

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags. See *CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS*.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags. See *CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS*.

## hare deps

*-d*
	Print dependency graph as a dot file for use with *graphviz*(1).

*-M*
	Print rules compatible with POSIX *make*(1).

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags. See *CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS*.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags. See *CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS*.

## hare run

*-v*
	Enable verbose logging. Prints every command to stderr before executing
	it.

	Defines the maximum number of jobs which *hare* will execute in
	parallel. The default is the number of processors available on the host.

	*pkg-config --libs* (see *pkg-config*(1)) to obtain the appropriate
	linker flags.

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags. See *CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS*.

# MODULES

The _path_ argument to *hare build* and *hare run* are used to identify the
inputs for the build. If this path is a file, it is treated as a single Hare
source file. If it is a directory, the directory is treated as a module, and is
placed in the global namespace for the build.

All files which end in *.ha* and *.s* are treated as inputs to the module, and
are respectively treated as Hare sources and assembly sources. A module with a
mix of assembly and Hare sources are considered *mixed* modules, and have some
special semantics.

The list of files considered eligible may be filtered by build tags. The format
for the filename is _name_[+_tags_]._ext_, where the _name_ is user-defined, the
_ext_ is either 'ha' or 's', and a list of tags are provided after the name. A
plus symbol ('+') will cause a file to be included only if that tag is present,
and a minus symbol ('-') will cause a file to be excluded if that tag is
present. Only one file for a given _name_ will be selected for the build, and
among files with eligible tags, the one with the most tag specifiers is
selected.

For example, if the following files are present in a directory:

- foo.ha
- bar.ha
- bar+linux.ha
- bar+plan9.ha
- baz+x86_64.s
- bat-x86_64.ha

If the build tags are +linux+x86_64, then the files which are included in the
module are foo.ha, bar+linux.ha, and baz+x86_64.s.

Additionally, subdirectories in a module will be considered part of that module
if their name consists *only* of a tag set, e.g. "+linux" or "-x86_64". A
directory with a name *and* tag set is never considered as part of any module,
such as "example+linux". A directory with only a name (e.g. "example") is
considered a sub-module of its parent directory and must be imported separately,
so "foo::bar" refers to foo/bar/.

# DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION

The "use" statements in each source file which is used as an input to *hare
build* or *hare run* are scanned and used to determine the dependencies for the
program, and this process is repeated for each dependency to obtain a complete
dependency graph.

Dependencies are searched for by examining first the current working directory,
then each component of the *HAREPATH* environment variable in order, which is a
list of paths separated by colons. The default value of the *HAREPATH* may be
found with the *hare version -v* command. Typically, it is set to include the
path to the standard library installed on the system, as well as a
system-provided storage location for third-party modules installed via the
system package manager.

# ARCHITECTURES

The *-t* flag for *hare build* is used for cross-compilation, and selects a
architecture different from the host to target. The list of supported
architectures is:

- aarch64
- riscv64
- x86_64

The system usually provides reasonable defaults for the *AR*, *AS*, and *LD*
tools based on the desired target. However, you may wish to set these variables
yourself to control the cross toolchain in use.

# CUSTOMIZING BUILD TAGS

Build tags allow you to add constraints on what features or platforms are
enabled for your build. A tag is a name, consisting of alphanumeric characters
and underscores, and a + or - prefix to signal inclusivity or exclusivity. See
*MODULES* for details on how build tags affect module input selection.

To add new tag constraints, inclusive or exclusive, use the *-T* flag. "-T
+foo-bar" will include the 'foo' tag and exclude the 'bar' tag. To remove
constraints, use the *-X* in a similar fashion; "-X +foo-bar" will reverse the
previous *-T* example.

Some tags are enabled by default, enabling features for the host platform. You
can view the default tagset by running *hare version -v*. To remove all default
tags, use "-X^".

# ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect *hare*'s execution:
