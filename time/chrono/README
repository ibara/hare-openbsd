The time::chrono submodule provides the basis for chronology in Hare,
namely [[timescale]]s (leap second handling), [[timezone]]s, and the
[[moment]] type, an abstracted datetime for external modules to
interface with.

For working with the ISO 8601 Gregorian calendar, see the [[datetime]]
submodule.

Hare defines a chronology as a system used to name and order moments in
time. In practice, a chronology is the combination of a calendar (for
handling days) and a wall clock (for handling times throughout a day).
