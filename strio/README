strio provides string-related I/O operations, specifically to make efficient use
of memory while building strings incrementally. The main entry points to strio
are [[dynamic]] and [[fixed]]. Each of the utility functions (e.g.
[[appendrune]]) work correctly with any [[io::handle]], but for efficiency
reasons it is recommended that they are either a strio or [[bufio]] stream.
